# HPC
Logan's HPC lectures and presentations.
Hey Rob, I'm not actually a world renowned HPC presenter, just a humber IT guy who has done some things in the HPC realm. The resume is true, made fresh according to the book, and I presented once at HPCSWU, and got invited to present for ISCHPC, but didnt want to go to Germany for it. Didn't save the data though.
